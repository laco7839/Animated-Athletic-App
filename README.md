# Animated-Athletic-App
Figma app prototype with animations
# Process
For this assignment, I first created an app prototype on Figma. I chose to model mine after Garmin. I included the Heart Rate Status, the Body Battery, the Sleep Score, the HRV Status, and the Training Status. I tried to make it look as realistic as possible. Then, I added some animations to icons that I thought made sense for some movement. For example, the Refresh button should rotate when the user presses the refresh button. It should continue to rotate as the app loads new data, as it shows in the video. 
# Users
Anyone who is interested in athetlics and/or animations to see how they can be appropiately and effectively used.
# Learnings
It was really fun to create an app prototype of Garmin. Adding my own animations was difficult at first, but I think it came together nicely at the end. Overalll, I learned significantly more about Figma from this project and saw what I can do with animations.
